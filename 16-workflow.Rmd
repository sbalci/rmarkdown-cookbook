# Workflow

In this chapter, we introduce some tips on working with individual R Markdown documents as well as running your R Markdown projects. You may also check out [Chapter 30](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown-workflow.html) of the book "R for Data Science" [@wickham2016], which briefly introduced some tips on using analysis notebooks (including R Markdown documents). Nicholas Tierney also discussed the workflow in the book ["R Markdown for Scientists."](https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/workflow.html)

## RStudio keyboard shortcuts {#rstudio-shortcuts}

The R Markdown format can be used with any editor of your choice, as long as R, the **rmarkdown** package, and Pandoc are installed. However, RStudio has a deep integration with R Markdown so you can work with R Markdown smoothly.

Like any IDE (Integrated Development Environment), RStudio has keyboard shortcuts. A full list can be found under the menu `Tools -> Keyboard Shortcuts Help`. Some of the most useful shortcuts related to R Markdown are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:shortcuts).

```{r, include = FALSE}
ks_win <- function(letters, ctrl = TRUE, alt = TRUE, shift = FALSE, enter = FALSE) {
  paste0(
    if (ctrl) "Ctrl+",
    if (alt) "Alt+",
    if (shift) "Shift+",
    if (enter) "Enter+",
    letters
  )
}
ks_mac <- function(letters, cmd = TRUE, opt = TRUE, shift = FALSE, enter = FALSE) {
  paste0(
    if (cmd) "Command+",
    if (opt) "Option+",
    if (shift) "Shift+",
    if (enter) "Enter+",
    letters
  )
}
```

```{r shortcuts, echo = FALSE}
keyboard_table <- tibble::tribble(
  ~ "Task"             , ~ "Windows & Linux"                    , ~ "macOS",
  "Insert R chunk"            , ks_win("I")                            , ks_mac("I"),
  "Preview HTML"              , ks_win("K", alt = FALSE, shift = TRUE) , ks_mac("K", opt = FALSE, shift = TRUE),
  "Knitr document (knitr)"    , ks_win("K", alt = FALSE, shift = TRUE) , ks_mac("K", opt = FALSE, shift = TRUE),
  "Compile Notebook"          , ks_win("K", alt = FALSE, shift = TRUE) , ks_mac("K", opt = FALSE, shift = TRUE),
  "Compile PDF"               , ks_win("K", alt = FALSE, shift = TRUE) , ks_mac("K", opt = FALSE, shift = TRUE),
  "Run all chunks above"      , ks_win("P")                            , ks_mac("P"),
  "Run current chunk"         , ks_win("C")                            , ks_mac("C"),
  "Run current chunk"         , ks_win("Enter", TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)     , ks_mac("Enter", TRUE, FALSE, TRUE),
  "Run next chunk"            , ks_win("N")                            , ks_mac("N"),
  "Run all chunks"            , ks_win("R")                            , ks_mac("R"),
  "Go to next chunk/title"    , ks_win("PgDown", alt = FALSE)          , ks_mac("PgDown", opt = FALSE),
  "Go to previous chunk/title", ks_win("PgUp", alt = FALSE)            , ks_mac("PgUp", opt = FALSE),
  "Show/hide document outline", ks_win("O", TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)         , ks_mac("O", TRUE, FALSE, TRUE),
  "Build book, website, ..."  , ks_win("B", TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)         , ks_mac("B", TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
)
knitr::kable(keyboard_table, caption = "RStudio keyboard shortcuts related to R Markdown.", booktabs = TRUE)
```

Besides, you can press `F7` to spellcheck your document. You can also restart the R session by `Ctrl + Alt + F10` (or `Command + Option + F10` on macOS), which can be helpful for reproducibility, because results are more likely to be reproducible if they are computed from a new R session. This can also be done through the dropdown menu "Restart R and Run All Chunks" behind the "Run" button on the toolbar.

## Spell check R Markdown {#spell-check}

If you use the RStudio IDE, you can press the key `F7` or click the menu `Edit -> Check Spelling` to spell check an Rmd document. Real-time spell checking has become available in RStudio v1.3, so you no longer need to manually trigger spell checking with this version or a greater version of RStudio.

If you do not use RStudio, the **spelling** package (https://github.com/ropensci/spelling) has a function `spell_check_files()`, which can check the spelling of common document formats, including R Markdown. When spell checking Rmd documents, it will skip code chunks and only check ordinary text.

## Render R Markdown with `rmarkdown::render()` {#rmarkdown-render}

If you do not use RStudio or any other IDEs, you need to know this fact: R Markdown documents are rendered through the function `rmarkdown::render()`. This means you can programmatically render an R Markdown document in any R script. For example, you could render a series of reports in a `for`-loop for each state of a country:

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
for (state in state.name) {
  rmarkdown::render(
    'input.Rmd', output_file = paste0(state, '.html')
  )
}
```

The output filename will be different for each state. You can also make use of the `state` variable in the document `input.Rmd`, e.g.,

````md
---
title: "A report for `r knitr::inline_expr('state')`"
output: html_document
---

The area of `r knitr::inline_expr('state')` is `r knitr::inline_expr('state.area[state.name == state]')`
square miles.
````

You may read the help page `?rmarkdown::render` to know other possible arguments. Here we just want to mention two of them, i.e., the `clean` and `envir` arguments. The former (`clean`) is particularly helpful for debugging when anything goes wrong with the Pandoc conversion. If you call `rmarkdown::render(..., clean = FALSE)`, all intermediate files will be preserved, including the intermediate `.md` file knitted from the `.Rmd` file. If Pandoc signals an error, you may start debugging from this `.md` file. The latter (`envir`) offers a way to render a document with the guarantee of an empty new environment when you call `rmarkdown::render(..., envir = new.env())`, so objects created in your code chunks will stay inside this environment, without polluting your current global environment. On the other hand, if you prefer rendering the Rmd document in a new R session so that objects in your current R session will not pollute your Rmd document, you may call `rmarkdown::render` in `xfun::Rscript_call()`, e.g.,

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
xfun::Rscript_call(
  rmarkdown::render,
  list(input = 'my-file.Rmd', output_format = 'pdf_document')
)
```

This method is similar to clicking the `Knit` button in RStudio, which also renders the Rmd document in a new R session. In case you need to render an Rmd document inside another Rmd document, we strongly recommend that you used this method instead of directly calling `rmarkdown::render()` in a code chunk, because `rmarkdown::render()` creates and relies on a lot of side-effects internally, which may affect rendering other Rmd documents in the same R session.

The second argument of `xfun::Rscript_call()` takes a list of arguments to be passed to `rmarkdown::render`(). In fact, `xfun::Rscript_call` is a general-purpose function to call any R function (with arguments optionally) in a new R session. Please see its help page if you are interested.

## Parameterized reports {#parameterized-reports}

In Section \@ref(rmarkdown-render), we mentioned one way to render a series of reports in a `for`-loop. In fact, `rmarkdown::render()` has an argument named `params` specifically designed for this task. You can parameterize your report through this argument. When you specify parameters for a report, you can use the variable `params` in your report. For example, if you call:

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
for (state in state.name) {
  rmarkdown::render('input.Rmd', params = list(state = state))
}
```

Then in `input.Rmd`, the object `params` will be a list that contains the `state` variable:

````md
---
title: "A report for `r knitr::inline_expr('params$state')`"
output: html_document
---

The area of `r knitr::inline_expr('params$state')` is
`r knitr::inline_expr('state.area[state.name == params$state]')`
square miles.
````

Another way to specify parameters for a report is to use the YAML field `params`, e.g.,

```yaml
---
title: Parameterized reports
output: html_document
params:
  state: Nebraska
  year: 2019
  midwest: true
---
```

Note that you can include as many parameters in the `params` YAML field or the `params` argument of `rmarkdown::render()`. If both the YAML field and the argument are present, the parameter values in the argument will override the corresponding parameters in YAML. For example, when we call `rmarkdown::render(..., params = list(state = 'Iowa', year = 2018)` on the previous example that has the `params` field, `params$state` will become `Iowa` (instead of `Nebraska`) and `params$year` will become `2018` (instead of `2019`) in the R Markdown document.

When rendering the same R Markdown document to a series of reports, you need to adjust the `output_file` argument of `rmarkdown::render()`, to make sure each report has its unique filename, so you will not accidentally override certain report files. For example, you can write a function to generate a report for each state and each year:

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
render_one <- function(state, year) {
  # assuming the output format of input.Rmd is PDF
  rmarkdown::render(
    'input.Rmd',
    output_file = paste0(state, '-', year, '.pdf'),
    params = list(state = state, year = year),
    envir = parent.frame()
  )
}
```

Then you can use nested `for`-loops to generate all reports:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for (state in state.name) {
  for (year in 2000:2020) {
    render_one(state, year)
  }
}
```

At the end, you will get a series of report files like `Alabama-2000.pdf`, `Alabama-2001.pdf`, ..., `Wyoming-2019.pdf`, and `Wyoming-2020.pdf`.

For parameterized reports, you can also input parameters interactively through a graphical user interface (GUI) created from Shiny. This requires you to provide a `params` field in YAML, and **rmarkdown** will automatically create the GUI using the appropriate input widgets for each parameter (e.g., a checkbox will be provided for a boolean parameter).

To start the GUI, you can call `rmarkdown::render()` with `params = 'ask'` if you do not use RStudio:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::render('input.Rmd', params = 'ask')
```

If you use RStudio, you can click the menu `Knit with Parameters` behind the `Knit` button. Figure \@ref(fig:params-shiny) shows an example GUI for parameters.

```{r, params-shiny, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Knit an R Markdown document with parameters that you can input from a GUI.'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/params-shiny.png', dpi = NA)
```

For more information on parameterized reports, you may read [Chapter 15](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html) of the R Markdown book [@rmarkdown2018].

## Customize the `Knit` button {#custom-knit}

When you click the `Knit` button in RStudio, it will call the `rmarkdown::render()` function in a new R session and output a file of the same base name as the input file in the same directory. For example, knitting `example.Rmd` with the output format `html_document` will create an output file `example.html`.

There may be situations in which we want to customize how the document is rendered. For example, perhaps we would like the rendered document to contain the current date, or would like to output the compiled report into a different directory. Although we can achieve these goals by calling `rmarkdown::render()` (see Section \@ref(rmarkdown-render)) with the appropriate `output_file` argument, it can be inconvenient to have to rely on a custom call to `rmarkdown::render() to compile your report.

It is possible to control the behavior of the `Knit` button by providing the `knit` field within the YAML frontmatter of your document. The field takes a function with the main argument `input` (the path to the input Rmd document) and other arguments that are currently ignored. You can either write the source code of the function directly in the `knit` field, or put the function elsewhere (e.g., in an R package) and call the function in the `knit` field. If you routinely need the custom `knit` function, we would recommend that you put it in a package, instead of repeating its source code in every single R Markdown document.

If you store the code directly within YAML, you must wrap the entire function in parentheses. If the source code has multiple lines, you have to indent all lines (except the first line) by at least two spaces. For example, if we want the output filename to include the date on which it is rendered, we could use the following YAML code:

```yaml
---
knit: (function(input, ...) {
    rmarkdown::render(
      input,
      output_file = paste0(
        xfun::sans_ext(inputFile), '-', Sys.Date(), '.html'
      ),
      envir = globalenv()
    )
  })
---
``` 

For example, if we knit `example.Rmd` on 2019-07-29, the output filename will be `example-2019-07-29.html`.

While the above approach looks simple and straightforward enough, embedding a function directly in your YAML may make it difficult for you to maintain it, unless the function is only to be used once with a single R Markdown document. In general, we would recommend using an R package to maintain such a function, e.g., you may create a function `knit_with_date()` in a package:

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
#' Custom Knit function for RStudio
#'
#' @export
knit_with_date <- function(input, ...) {
  rmarkdown::render(
    input,
    output_file = paste0(
        xfun::sans_ext(inputFile), '-', Sys.Date(), '.',
        xfun::file_ext(inputFile)
    ),
    envir = globalenv()
  )
}
```

If you add the above code to a package named **myPackage**, you will be able to refer to your custom `knit` function using the following YAML setting:
  
```yaml
---
knit: myPackage::knit_with_date
---
```

You may refer to the help page `?rmarkdown::render` to find out more ideas on how you could customize your `knit` function behind the `Knit` button in RStudio.

## Collaborative editing of Rmd documents through Google Drive {#google-drive}

Based on the **googledrive** package, Emily Kothe provided a few wrapper functions in the **rmdrive** package, which is currently available only on GitHub at https://github.com/ekothe/rmdrive. At the time of writing, it still lacks rich documentation, so I recommend that you try Janosch Linkersdörfer's fork instead: https://github.com/januz/rmdrive (which is based on Ben Marwick's fork---if you still have not learned GIT, you may be motivated by these examples of freely forking and improving other people's GIT repositories).

The workflow with **rmdrive** is outlined below:

1. We assume there is a main author or contributor of the project, who is capable of using version control tools like GIT. The main author writes the initial version of the Rmd document, and upload it to Google Drive via the `upload_rmd()` function.

1. The Rmd document in Google Drive is shared with other collaborators, who can make or suggest changes in Google Document.

1. The main author can accept suggested changes, and download/preview the Rmd document locally via `render_rmd()`. Other collaborators can also do this by themselves if they have modified code chunks and want to see the new results.

1. If satisfied, the main author can commit changes to the GIT repository.

The collaborative editing can be either synchronous or asynchronous in Google Drive. Multiple people can edit the same document at the same time, or wait for other people to finish their editing first.

There is also a function `udpate_rmd()` in the package, which allows you to edit the Rmd document locally, and upload the local Rmd document to Google Drive. You probably should never want to run this function, because it will completely overwrite the document in Google Drive. The main author may want to warn collaborators about this in advance. Ideally, all collaborators should only edit the document in Google Drive and not locally. It is okay to preview the edited document locally via `render_rmd()`, though (note that `render_rmd()` automatically downloads the document before rendering it).

## Organize an R Markdown project into a research website with **workflowr** {#workflowr}

The **workflowr** package (https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr) can help you organize a (data analysis) project with a project template and the version control tool GIT. Every time you make a change to the project, you can log the change, and **workflowr** can build a website corresponding to that particular version of your project. This means that you will be able to view the full history of your analysis results. Although this package uses GIT as the backend for version control, you do not really have to be familiar with GIT, because it has provided R functions that do the GIT operations under the hood, and you only need to call these R functions. Please see the package documentation for how to get started and more information.

The main author of **workflowr**, John Blischak, has also put together a non-exhaustive list of R packages and guides related to the workflow of R projects, which can be found in this GitHub repo: https://github.com/jdblischak/r-project-workflows.

## Send Emails based on R Markdown {#blastula-email}

With the **blastula** package (https://github.com/rich-iannone/blastula), you can render an Rmd document to the Email body and send the Email. To render an Rmd document to an Email, the document needs to use the output format `blastula::blastula_email`, e.g.,

````md
---
title: Weekly Report
output: blastula::blastula_email
--- 

Dear Boss,

Below is an analysis of the `iris` data:

```{r}`r ''`
summary(iris)
plot(iris[, -5])
```

Please let me know if it is not boring enough.

Sincerely,  
John
````

This Rmd document should be rendered via the function `blastula::render_email()`, and the output can be passed to `blastula::smtp_send()`, which will send out the Email. Note that `smtp_send()` needs an Email server as well as your credentials.

If you use RStudio Connect, you can find more examples at https://solutions.rstudio.com/examples/blastula-overview/, including automated, conditional, and parameterized emails.
